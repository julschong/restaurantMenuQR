# QR Restaurant Menu
 
I'm currently still working on this project.

# Main Idea
A platform for restaurant owner to set up simple Menu and order system using QR code

# Use cases
User (Owner) story
- Create account and login
- Create restaurants, add locations, set up tables
- Create Menu and Menu items
- Generate QR code for print out
- View current table orders

End User (Customers) story
- scan QR code
- look at menu and add into order cart
- submit order
